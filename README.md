# Kaos Captcha Generator

A robust, highly resilient CAPTCHA generator designed to resist automated OCR and AI-based solving attempts. This script produces randomized numeric captchas with multiple obfuscation layers, including rotation, color variation, spacing irregularities, varied fonts, and noise lines.

It is suitable for web applications where **strong anti-bot protection** is required while remaining readable to human users.

### Obfuscation and Security Analysis

This captcha script is designed for **entropy and OCR resistance**. The installer produces **site-specific** randomized parameters (fonts, rotation ranges, spacing, color ranges, noise density) so each deployment yields a distinct image distribution. The following breakdown describes how each obfuscation layer contributes to overall resilience and shows a conservative example calculation using typical values produced by the installer.

---

#### 1. Random Character Sequence

* Each captcha has **6 characters (alphanumeric)** → `57` possibilities per character (excluding ambiguous characters like `0, O, 1, l, I`).
* Entropy formula: `H = log2(N^L) = L * log2(N)`
* Calculated entropy (sequence only):
  `H_sequence = 6 * log2(57) ≈ 35.0 bits`
* This is the **baseline entropy** coming from the alphanumeric sequence alone.

---

#### 2. Font Variability (per-install)

* Installer selects **8 fonts** (from local `fonts/` or public fallbacks) and embeds that list into the generated `captcha.php`.
* Entropy per character (conservative estimate): `log2(8) ≈ 3 bits`
* For 6 characters: `H_fonts = 6 * 3 = 18 bits`

> Note: fonts are chosen at install time (not per-request). If production fonts are leaked, an attacker could reduce entropy — do not publish production fonts.

---

#### 3. Rotation (per-character)

* Rotation range roughly **−30° to +30°** → 61 integer angles.
* Entropy per character: `log2(61) ≈ 5.93 bits`
* For 6 characters: `6 * 5.93 ≈ 35.6 bits`

---

#### 4. Color Variation (per-character)

* Each RGB channel is randomized within a constrained range to avoid extremes, giving up to **24 bits per character** in theory.
* For 6 characters: `H_color = 6 * 24 = 144 bits`
* OCR may ignore color channels, but color remains a strong confounder for segmentation.

---

#### 5. Horizontal Spacing & Vertical Jitter

* Horizontal spacing: `spacing_range ≈ 6–14 px` → 21 integer possibilities per gap
* 5 gaps between 6 characters: `H_spacing = 5 * log2(21) ≈ 23.9 bits`
* Vertical jitter adds further segmentation uncertainty (not fully counted above).

---

#### 6. Noise Lines (per-image)

* Installer selects **12–24 lines**, each with randomized start/end and color.
* Conservative per-line entropy: `≈ 53.07 bits`
* Using **18 lines** average: `H_lines ≈ 955.26 bits`

> Lines are the primary OCR-resistance feature — the practical difficulty they introduce outweighs raw entropy numbers.

---

#### 7. Total approximate entropy (conservative example)

* Representative values:

| Layer       | Entropy (bits) |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| Sequence    | 35.0           |
| Fonts       | 18.0           |
| Rotation    | 35.6           |
| Color       | 144.0          |
| Spacing     | 23.9           |
| Noise Lines | 955.26         |

* Sum: `H_total ≈ 1211.76 bits`
* Conservative lower-bound (ignore color and lines): `35 + 18 + 35.6 + 23.9 ≈ 112.5 bits`

> **Interpretation:** Even ignoring color and line noise, off-the-shelf OCR or AI solvers face **>100 bits of uncertainty** — extremely resistant to automated attacks without targeted, site-specific training.

---

### 8. Testing Methodology

The generator was rigorously tested using a **tiered Python OCR testing suite**, with difficulty levels ranging from basic thresholding to advanced segmentation and line-inpainting techniques:

* **Easy**: Grayscale + Otsu thresholding
* **Medium**: Denoising + adaptive thresholding + morphological operations
* **Hard**: Line removal + color clustering + thresholding
* **Expert**: Full pipeline with segmentation, inpainting, and fallback OCR

#### Results

* **Kaos Captchas**: **100% OCR failure rate** across hundreds of generated images and multiple retries. No test or variation has solved a single captcha
* **Other captchas** (white background, black digits, no obfuscation - tested as a control to validate results of Kaos Captcha tests): **100% OCR success rate** across all difficulty levels.

---

### 9. Interpretation

* **Line noise and color variability** are the most effective defenses.
* **Rotation, fonts, and spacing** further impede automated segmentation.
* Combined, the captcha is **effectively unreadable by standard OCR** without bespoke model training.
* Theoretical maximum entropy (~1153 bits) ensures **robust security against automated attacks**.

# **Installation and Usage Instructions — CAPTCHA Installer**

The `install_captcha.php` script generates a **site-specific** `captcha.php` file containing randomized visual parameters and a font selection list.  
This approach ensures that each deployment’s CAPTCHA instance is unique and resistant to signature-based bypasses.

---

## **1. Prerequisites**

1. **PHP CLI** must be available.  
   Confirm by running:
   ```bash
   which php
   ```
   If PHP is not found, use the full path to your PHP binary (for example, `/usr/bin/php`).

2. Ensure the **target directory** (the web application’s root or form handler directory) is:
   - Writable by the user executing the script
   - Accessible by your web server (e.g., Apache, NGINX)

3. Install the **GD extension** (required for image generation):
   ```bash
   php -m | grep gd
   ```
   If not found, install it using your package manager or enable it in PHP settings.

4. Optionally, create a `fonts/` directory in your target path and add `.ttf` files to it.  
   If fewer than eight fonts are found, public fallback fonts will be listed in the output.

---

## **2. Setting Up CAPTCHA_PEPPER**

`CAPTCHA_PEPPER` is an environment variable used to introduce installation-specific entropy.  
It ensures that random values (e.g., digit placement, color distribution, and rotation) differ per deployment and cannot be easily predicted or cloned.

### Example (Linux):
Add to your environment configuration, such as `/etc/environment`:
```
CAPTCHA_PEPPER="your-long-random-secret"
```

Then reload the environment (or restart the web server):
```bash
source /etc/environment
```

This 48-character secret is sufficient and cryptographically sound for this purpose.

---

## **3. Running the Installer**

Execute from the command line:

```bash
php install_captcha.php /path/to/target/dir
```

**Example:**
```bash
php install_captcha.php /var/www/vhosts/example.com/httpdocs/
```

**Expected output:**
```
Generated /var/www/vhosts/example.com/httpdocs/captcha.php with randomized parameters.
Fonts used (update your 'fonts/' folder with these names if needed):
 - DejaVuSans-Bold.ttf
 - LiberationSans-Bold.ttf
 ...
```

---

## **4. Verifying Installation**

After installation:
- The file `/path/to/target/dir/captcha.php` should exist.
- Open `https://example.com/captcha.php` in a browser — it should render a CAPTCHA image.
- If the image fails to render, check:
  - PHP GD extension is enabled.
  - Correct permissions on the `fonts/` and `white.jpg` files (if used).

---

## **5. Using the CAPTCHA**

### **In your HTML form:**
```html
<form method="post" action="form_handler.php">
            <div>
                <h5><br>Bot Check:</h5>
                <p>
                    <img id="captcha_img" name="captcha_img" src="captcha.php" alt="Captcha Image" title="Enter the numbers from this image into the input field below">
                </p>
                <p>
                    <input type="text" id="captcha" name="captcha" maxlength="6" onkeyup="this.value = this.value.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]+/g, '');" style="height:25px;" placeholder="Enter Code" required>

                    <a href="#" onclick="document.getElementById('captcha_img').src = './captcha.php?' + Math.random(); document.getElementById('captcha').value = ''; return false;"><img src="./refresh.png" style="width:40px;" alt="Refresh the Image" title="If you have trouble seeing the numbers, click this button to refresh the image."></a>
                    <br>
                    <small>Enter the numbers from the image above.</small>
                </p>
				<div class="col-md-6 button">
					<button class="btn btn-primary d-block w-100" name="submit" type="submit">Submit</button>
				</div>
            </div>
</form>
```

### **In your form handler (form_handler.php):**
```php
<?php
session_start();  // <-- required before using $_SESSION

if (isset($_POST['captcha'], $_SESSION['captcha'])) {
    // Normalize both values to uppercase for case-insensitive comparison
    $userInput = strtoupper(trim($_POST['captcha']));
    $storedCaptcha = strtoupper(trim($_SESSION['captcha']));

    if ($userInput === $storedCaptcha) {
        // captcha is valid
		// Process form submission code goes below here
    } else {
        // Invalid captcha
    }

    // Remove the captcha so it cannot be reused
    unset($_SESSION['captcha']);
} else {
    echo "Captcha or session missing!";
}
?>
```

## **6. Regenerating or Resetting CAPTCHA**

You can safely regenerate the site-specific CAPTCHA (for example, after updating font files or changing the pepper) by rerunning the installer:

```bash
php install_captcha.php /path/to/target/dir
```

This overwrites the previous `captcha.php` with new randomized parameters.

---

## **7. Security Notes**

- **Never commit** the generated `captcha.php` file to public repositories.  
  It contains installation-specific randomization parameters that should remain private.
- Ensure that your pepper is stored securely and not exposed in any logs or web-accessible files.
- Regenerate the CAPTCHA occasionally to vary its characteristics further.

---

## General Notes

* **Line noise and color variation** are the strongest defenses against OCR.
* **Rotation, fonts, and spacing** add additional segmentation resistance.
* The script is designed to **resist even advanced, multi-tiered automated attacks**.
